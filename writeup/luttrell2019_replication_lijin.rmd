## Introduction

<a href="#reference">Luttrell et al. ( 2019)</a> investigated the whether the influence of moral counterattitudinal messages on attitude change depends on the extent that the initial attitudes were moralized.  They further explored the mediation effect of the perceptions/thoughts toward the message and the moderation effect of political orientation. To test the hypotheses, they conducted two studies on the attitudes toward recycling.


### Justification
I choose this paper to replicate because I have been working on factor analysis and structural equation modeling, thus I am very interested in self-reported data. This paper matches my research experiences and interests as it focused on variables (e.g., attitude) that were measured by scales. Besides, this paper used questionnaires to measure the variables of interest and the reliabilities of the questionnaires were reported in the paper. However, the construct validity was not reported in the paper. In addition to replicating the research, I want to further test the validity of the measurement tools used in this paper.


### Stimuli and Procedures


I will replicate the study 1 of <a href="#reference">Luttrell et al. ( 2019)</a>. This experiment will be conducted through [qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) and participants will be required to fill out a survey. At the beginning of the survey, participants will be asked to read an introduction to recycling and report their attitude about recycling.


Next, participants will be randomly assigned into two groups, and in one group, they will need to read a message arguing against recycling using a moral appeal. In another group, participants will be assigned a message arguing against recycling using a practical appeal. After reading the message, participants in each group need to report their attitudes toward recycling again. Also, they will be asked about their perceptions of the message, political orientation, age, gender, and the primary language they are using. The questionnaire on attitude toward recycling, political orientation, perceptions about the message, as well as the stimuli (practical or moral arguments against recycling) used in the replication study will be the same as <a href="#reference">Luttrell et al. ( 2019)</a>.

### Challenge 
The potential challenge in this study is the funding to collect sufficient samples. In the original paper, the authors took one dollar to recruit each participant, and they recruited around 200 people.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


##Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
###Data Preparation

####Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

####Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

###Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
